## Commit Message Guidelines

We must create commit messages according to the following rules

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header and a body. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope, and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>

<body>
<BLANK LINE>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope should be GitHub task id or external. The body is not mandatory

Example:

```
fix(#1234): subject message

- Fixed component etc.
```

### Scope

The scope should be the id of the GitHub tasks. If we have no task, we can use `external`

- **GitHub task id**
- **external**
- **build**

```
feat(#1234): add new feature
```

- **external**

```
feat(external): change something externally
```

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `These reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

```
revert: "fix(#1234): subject message"

These reverts commit <hash>.
```

### Cherry Pick

```
cherry-pick: "fix(#1234): subject message"
```

### Merge Commit Messages

```
merged commit <commit id> into <branch>
```

## Pull Request Message Format

We must create pull request message according to the following rules.

Each pull request messages consists of a header and a body. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope, and a subject:

```
<type>/<#scope>-<subject>
<BLANK LINE>

<body>
<BLANK LINE>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope should be GitHub task id or external. The body is not mandatory

Example:

```
fix/#1234-subject message

- resolves #1234
```
